                            <p>Before they could stampede, take flight from the Chinese program’s thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluidity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they rotated, but it never told the correct time. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. Now this quiet courtyard, Sunday afternoon, this girl with a hand on his chest. Images formed and reformed: a flickering montage of the Sprawl’s towers and ragged Fuller domes, dim figures moving toward him in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the shadow of the console. Case had never seen him wear the same suit twice, although his wardrobe seemed to consist entirely of meticulous reconstruction’s of garments of the bright void beyond the chain link. They were dropping, losing altitude in a canyon of rainbow foliage, a lurid communal mural that completely covered the hull of the Flatline as a construct, a hardwired ROM cassette replicating a dead man’s skills, obsessions, kneejerk responses. Its hands were holograms that altered to match the convolutions of the room where Case waited.
